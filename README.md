# WordPress Install Script

This is a boilerplate and installation script for WordPress with the WP core as a dependency and some other stuff. This new version moves away from PHP in favor of a shell script.

### Running the installer willâ€¦

-   Download the repository and prepare the custom folder structure.
-   Creates project files: readme.md, changelog.md, tasks.todo, notes.md, and a humans.txt
-   Rename the `core` and `wp-content` folders.
-   Create an `uploads` folder outside of wp-content.
-   Set runtime environment configurations.
-   Create fresh secret keys for each runtime environment.
-   Create a minimal `composer.json` for you to configure.

3. Or make it globally available (`sudo mv wpinit.sh /usr/local/bin/wpinit`)
4. Set your environment (see below), default is 'production'
